        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          If you are looking for an un-selfish, teamplayer, go getter individuel you have found your person! I love figuring out how things work equally as much as I love getting code to work the first time. When i'm not behind a screen typing i'm either behind another screen gaming or catching some rays outside with my dog.
